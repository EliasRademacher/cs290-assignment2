		"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of
		Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the
		delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up
		to London, where she entered an officers' hospital. First month: Washed
		up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted
		to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.
		Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:
		Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth
		month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance
		and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters!
		Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven's
		egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important
		matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the
		mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I
		found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,
		Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was
		affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in
		company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant
		Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties
		resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a
		blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively
		a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the
		pleasantest. He was quite a young general!"
		"What blighter was that?" inquired Tommy. "Perfectly sickening the way
		those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy, and from the
		Savoy to the War Office!"</p>
		
		<p>"I've forgotten his name now," confessed Tuppence. "To resume, that was
		in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We
		had several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a
		land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off
		my career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the
		true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at
		last. Since then I've been looking for a job. Now then--your turn."		
		"There's not so much promotion in mine," said Tommy regretfully, "and a
		great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then
		they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time,
		and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the
		Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I
		told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I've
		been job hunting! There aren't any jobs! And, if there were, they
		wouldn't give 'em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business?
		Nothing."</p>
